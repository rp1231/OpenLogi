//! Agent IPC client.
//!
//! The agent owns all device I/O, so the GUI never opens a device — it connects
//! to the agent's local socket and (a) keeps one [`Agent::observe`] request open
//! for the agent's state, and (b) forwards "apply now" / "read" device commands.
//! Both run on one dedicated OS thread with a tokio runtime (the GPUI thread owns
//! no async runtime): results cross back over `mpsc` to the GPUI loop.
//!
//! There is no poll cadence to tune. `observe` carries a generation, and the
//! agent answers the moment its state differs from the one this client last saw,
//! so the GUI is told *when* to look instead of asking on a timer — and because
//! every answer is the complete state, a reconnect needs no resynchronisation:
//! ask again with generation 0 and the next answer is the whole truth.
//!
//! The connection is one [`link::Link`]: while up it owns the client, the
//! generation ledger and the poll in flight; while down it owns the outage
//! clock and what the window has been told about it. What is left to time is
//! failure. `launch::spawn_agent` brings the agent up when the socket stays
//! down — gated by [`reflex::SpawnReflex`], which fires immediately for an
//! agent that was never reachable but gives a lost connection
//! [`reflex::SPAWN_AFTER_LOSS`] first (the deliberate quits and the supervised
//! restarts announce themselves within that window) and never fires at a live
//! agent newer than this GUI. An outage longer than `link::UNREACHABLE_AFTER`
//! is pushed to the GUI as [`GuiUpdate::Unreachable`] so the window can say so
//! instead of waiting forever. A dead agent is noticed the moment the socket
//! closes; a *hung* one is noticed when its hold window passes without an
//! answer.
//!
//! Device commands are transient: one that finds no connection is answered as
//! unavailable by the request itself ([`request::Request::deliver`]) and the
//! next snapshot repairs the panel. A config reload is not — `config.toml` has already changed on disk and the
//! agent must re-read it — but neither is it urgent while no agent is running:
//! an agent that starts reads the file anyway. So `ReloadConfig` is held as
//! state rather than dispatched: the loop delivers it over the next live
//! connection and reports the agent's verdict then. That is what keeps an app
//! relaunch that outruns its agent (every self-update does) from latching a
//! "not applied" notice the agent's arrival could never clear.
