//! Connecting a client to the agent, handshake and all.
//!
//! Every client — the settings app, the overlay helper, the CLI — has to
//! connect, wrap the stream, spawn the tarpc client, check the agent's protocol
//! version, and declare what kind of client it is before any real RPC. That
//! sequence is a policy, and a policy every consumer must apply identically has
//! exactly one owner. This module exports the *decision* — [`connect_as`]
//! either yields a usable [`AgentClient`] or says why not in [`ConnectError`] —
//! and keeps the ingredients (the raw version number, the declare call) out of
//! the public surface, so no consumer can recombine them a second way.
//!
//! The one caller that legitimately judges a version without declaring itself
//! is the agent's own takeover handshake, which must recognise an *older* lock
//! holder without waking it. It gets [`probe_version`] and judges the answer
//! with [`ProtocolSkew::check`], the same rule.
//!
//! Both entry points give the agent [`HANDSHAKE_DEADLINE`] to answer, so no
//! caller wraps them in a timeout of its own: an agent that cannot answer the
//! two handshake calls from memory in that window is wedged, not busy.
//!
//! The rest of what every observing client repeats lives here too: the
//! per-connection generation [`Ledger`], the request [`observe_context`] whose
//! deadline outlasts the agent's hold, and the dedicated thread the GPUI
//! processes run their client loop on ([`spawn_client_thread`]).
