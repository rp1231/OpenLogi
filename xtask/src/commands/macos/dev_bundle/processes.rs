//! What is already running when a dev build starts, and what to do about it.
//!
//! The dev agent is launched through LaunchServices (`open -g -n`, so it is its
//! own TCC responsible process), which also means it is not a child of the GUI
//! and not in the terminal's process group: closing the window or pressing
//! Ctrl-C ends the GUI and leaves the agent and its overlay running, invisible
//! but for the menu-bar icon. Leaving them is not neutral either — this command
//! rewrites the binaries the resident agent watches, so ~20 s into the session
//! its own update watcher would relaunch it, mid-test. Stopping them first
//! makes every run start from a known state.
