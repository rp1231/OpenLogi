//! Which certificate the dev bundle is signed with, and remembering it.
//!
//! macOS ties an Accessibility or Input-Monitoring grant to the bundle's
//! designated requirement, which for a development certificate pins the leaf
//! cert. Signing the dev bundles with a *different* certificate therefore
//! silently voids every permission the developer granted them — and
//! `security find-identity` returns no guaranteed order, so picking the first
//! line is exactly how that happens on a machine with more than one Apple
//! Development identity.
//!
//! So the choice is remembered, outside `target/`: `cargo clean` wipes the
//! bundle but not the grants. It changes only when the remembered certificate
//! has left the keychain — an annual rotation — and that case is announced
//! rather than left looking like a mystery.
